********************************************************************
*  IMPORTANT NOTE IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AtariSIO VERSION 0.30  *
********************************************************************

The new kernel driver supports multiple interfaces (4 per default)
which are now named /dev/atarisio0 ... /dev/atarisio3 instead of
just /dev/atarisio.

If you are using kernel 2.4 together with devfs, you need to update
your modules.conf or /etc/modutils/atarisio file with the current
version shipped with this release.

If you are using a kernel with a static /dev filesystem (i.e. if
you don't use devfs or udev), remove the old /dev/atarisio node
and run "make devices" to create the new /dev/atarisioX nodes.


********************************************************************
*  IMPORTANT NOTE IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AtariSIO VERSION 0.20  *
********************************************************************

If you previously used AtariSIO V0.20 together with devfs and
set devfsd to save permissions in "/dev-state/", please stop
devfsd, remove the file "atarisio" in "/dev-state/" and start
devfsd again. The devfs code has been changed and otherwise
AtariSIO won't work!

Since version 0.30 the AtariSIO kernel module supports
disabling of the serial driver, so the "setserial ... uart none"
hack is no longer needed. Please use one of the supplied new
module configuration templates (atarisio-ttySx).


1. You need several things to compile and use AtariSIO:

   * a 2.2.x, 2.4.x, or 2.6.x  version of the Linux kernel, with
     enabled module support
   * the kernel headers, matching your running linux kernel
   * glibc 2.1 or newer
   * libncurses 5.2 or newer
   * libreadline (if you want to use the "old" (non-ncurses)
     atariserver frontend
   * zlib is useful, so you can transparently access compressed
     disk images

   Depending on your Linux distribution you may also need to install
   the development packages for glibc/libncurses/libreadline/zlib.
   For example, in Debian Woody these packages are named libc6-dev,
   libncurses5-dev, libreadline4-dev, and zlib1g-dev.

   Furthermore, you'll need a fully 16550 compatible serial port.
   If you have a serial port on your mainboard, it most certainly
   will work, but eg. a USB-to-serial converter doesn't work.

   Then, you need a SIO2PC interface and/or a 1050-2-PC interface
   cable to connect your Atari (1050) to your PC. I won't describe
   how to build such a cable in this document, so just download
   SIO2PC and read it's documentation.

   AtariSIO supports the following interfaces:
   - one chip SIO2PC (with MAX232), command connected to RI
   - one chip SIO2PC, command connected to DSR
   - one chip SIO2PC, command connected to RTS
   - 1050-2-PC (with MAX232), command connected to RTS
   - Ape ProSystem cable (with 14C89), command connected to DTR

   The old two-chip SIO2PC interface (with a MAX232 and an LS368)
   is NOT supported, and probably never will be.

2. Edit the Makefile

   Sorry, no autoconf yet - you'll have to do the config manually.

   If you are using kernel 2.6.x, uncomment the "USE_KBUILD_26 = 1"
   line, if you are using kernel 2.2.x or 2.4.x, leave this line
   commented out.

   Set "KDIR" to the directory containing your linux kernel source
   (or, at least, the kernel headers).  Usually this is
   /usr/src/linux/.

   On some systems with non-standard linux header files (eg Red Hat
   Linux) you may need to set the kernel version ("VERSION") or
   the kernel module directory ("MDIR") manually.

   Change the installation directory "INST_DIR", if needed
   (default is /usr/local).

   In case you don't have zlib installed on your system, or if
   you don't want .gz-file support, comment out the definition of
   "ZLIB_CXX_FLAGS" and "ZLIB_LD_FLAGS".

   If you don't use kernel 2.6.x with the kernel build system,
   the most important part in Makefile configuration is selecting
   the right gcc version for compiling the kernel module. You must
   not use a different major gcc version than it was used to compile
   the linux kernel, otherwise your system may crash!
   
   First of all do a "cat /proc/version" to get the gcc version used
   for compiling the kernel.

   If "gcc --version" reports the same version number, everything
   is fine.

   If the version numbers don't match, find out how the gcc with
   the right version number is named and edit the "KERNEL_CC"
   definition in the Makefile.

3. Type "make dep" and "make"

   This should compile all programs without warnings.
   If you get something like
   /tmp/xxx.s:9: Warning: ignoring changed section attributes for .modinfo
   just ignore it, It's harmless.

   If you want to use the old-style (non-curses) atariserver frontend
   type "make atariserver-nocurses". You'll then have to install it
   manually, since "make install" doesn't include it.

4. Become root and type "make install"

   This will copy the kernel driver atarisio.o to the "misc" directory
   of your kernel modules (eg. /lib/modules/2.4.26/misc) and
   install atariserver and atarixfer in the installation directory.

   If you are NOT using udev/devfs, you have to create the device nodes
   /dev/atarisio0..3 by typing "make devices". The default permissions
   are set to "660", you may want to change them to something more
   appropriate.

   At the moment I'm using a major number of 10 and a minor number of
   240..243 for the (character) device drivers. These numbers are reserved
   for experimental use. In case this number pair is already by
   another driver, you can change the minor number of atarisio with
   the module parameter "minor=...". You'll also have to change
   the minor number in the modules.conf / modutils / modprobe.d file and
   on the /dev/atarisioX device nodes (if you don't use udev/devfs),
   of course.

   Please note that atariserver and atarixfer are installed setuid root.
   You can also run these utilities with normal user privileges, but then
   they won't be able to take advantage of realtime scheduling priorities.
   In other words: performance might be better when run with root privileges.

5. Activate the kernel driver
   
   Due to the design of the linux kernel, the serial port chip can
   only be accessed when the built-in linux serial driver for that
   port is disabled. Until AtariSIO V0.20 this had to be done
   manually by calling "setserial /dev/ttySx uart none".

   Since AtariSIO V0.30 this can be handeled automatically by the
   kernel driver.

   In general this means: if your serial port(s) are properly
   configured, you only have set the "port=" module parameter of
   atarisio (eg "port=/dev/ttyS0") and the kernel module will
   disable the serial driver for that port, read the IO and IRQ
   settings from the serial configuration, and will also re-enable
   the serial port when the atarisio kernel module is unloaded.

   If you have a non-standard setup (or if your serial ports are not
   configured properly yet) you may still use the "io=" and "irq="
   module parameters to override the IO/IRQ configuration obtained
   from the serial driver.

   Please note: if you don't pass a "port=" parameter to atarisio,
   you are responsible to disable the serial driver and properly
   set the "io=" and "irq=" parameters!

   Have a look at the supplied "atarisio-ttySx" files, choose the
   one matching your setup, and add it to your module configuration:

   * If you are using modutils (standard for 2.2 and 2.4 kernels),
     the configuration is usually stored in /etc/modules.conf
     or (for example in Debian Woody) in the /etc/modutils/ directory.
     In the latter case, running "update-modules" will automatically
     build the modules.conf file from the /etc/modutils/ directory.

   * If you are using the module-init-tools package (required for
     kernel 2.6), the configuration is usually stored in
     /etc/modprobe.conf or in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory.
     Again, run "update-modules" after you have copied the
     atarisio-ttySx file to this directory.

   Now load the module with "modprobe atarisio". It should load in fine
   and a line similar this should be added to your syslog:

   atarisio0: minor=240 port=/dev/ttyS0 io=0x03f8 irq=4

   If you get a line saying:

   atarisio: please supply port or io and irq parameters

   then you stored the configuration in the wrong place. In this case
   please consult the documentation of your Linux distribution about
   the proper location.
   
   If you are using devfs, have a look into the "/dev/" directory.
   There should be a link "/dev/atarisio0" to "/dev/misc/atarisio0" and
   a device node named "atarisio0" in the directory "/dev/misc/".

   In case of troubles have a look at the syslog-output of atarisio.
   Loading atarisio will usually fail in one of the following cases:
   - if you passed a non-existant serial port device
   - if it could not disable the linux serial driver
   - if you don't have a 16550(A) (compatible) UART
   - if the IO port region is used by another driver

   Note: The supplied modutils-ttySx templates contain all information
   needed by the kernel module autoloader to automatically load the
   atarisio module as soon as "/dev/atarisio0" is accessed. So there's
   no need to manually load the atarisio module (if your kernel supports
   autoloading, of course).

   If you want support for more than one SIO2PC / 1050-2-PC interface
   just pass a comma separated list of serial devices / io-ports / irqs
   to the kernel driver. For example:

   options atarisio port=/dev/ttyS0,/dev/ttyS1

   (in your modules.conf file) or - directly on the command line:

   modprobe atarisio port=/dev/ttyS0,/dev/ttyS1

   This will enable /dev/atarisio0 on your first serial port and
   /dev/atarisio1 on your second serial port.
   
6. Troubleshooting

   If you didn't install the kernel module correctly, the utilities
   will most likely bail out with an error message saying
   "unable to open /dev/atarisioX". If that's the case, look into
   syslog ("/var/log/syslog" or "/var/log/messages") if you can
   find some error messages from atarisio, and re­check the last
   steps.

   You'll also get "unable to open /dev/atarisioX" if another
   program is using /dev/atarisioX.

   If your system locks up when using atariserver although you have
   been using the same gcc version as it was used for kernel compilation,
   this might be due to a gcc problem. Especially several older
   non-official gcc snapshot releases are known to cause troubles.
   In this case, try using another gcc version, for example 2.95.

   If you run "make clean" all object files and executables will
   be deleted, but not the 6502 binary files (*.bin). To remove
   these files, too, run "make allclean". Note: you need to have
   ATasm 1.05 (or newer) installed to assemble the 6502 code.

7. Uninstalling

   If you've got enough of AtariSIO, just become root and use
   "make uninstall" to remove it.

8. Building the text-mode (non-curses) atariserver program

   In case you want to use the old (pre-0.30) version of atariserver,
   edit "tools/Makefile" and add "atariserver-nocurses" to the list
   of EXECUTABLES at the very beginning of the Makefile.
   atariserver-nocurses is not installed automatically (by calling
   "make install", so you have to copy it by hand to the
   installation directory.

   Please note that the old version is not supported any more, new
   features will only be available in the newer (curses) version of
   atariserver.
