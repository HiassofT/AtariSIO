    make variable, eg "make DEFAULT_DEVICE=/dev/ttyUSB0"

    overlay files
  - atariserver: change options to select command line:
    use '-C' for CTS and '-D' for DSR
  - atarixfer: fix occasional errors with Happy 1050 drive

    to "relaxed" mode. Strict timing on Linux drivers is needed to get
    1050 Turbo drives working with atarixfer.
  - atariserver: drop "highspeed with pauses" mode with kernel driver
    and make that available via "relaxed" SIO timing.
